                <p>Mangu is a beloved Dominican dish made from boiled down and mashed green plantains, known for its smooth creamy texture and comforting flavors. Mangu is typically served as part of a traditional breakfast called "los tres golpes," it's paired with fried cheese, salami, and eggs, which creates a satisfying meal. The dish has roots in African culinary traditions, reflecting the island's cultural heritage and long-standing appreciation for plantains. Whether it is enjoyed at home or in local eateries, Mangu is more than just food but rather a symbol for Dominican identity, warmth, and community. </p>
